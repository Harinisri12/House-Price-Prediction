# House Price Prediction
This repository contains scripts for predicting house prices using machine learning models implemented in Python, leveraging scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

## The goal of this project is to develop and compare two models:

- Linear Regression: A traditional statistical method used for predicting numerical outcomes.
- Neural Network: A more advanced model capable of learning complex patterns in data.

## Files

- ml.py: Contains the implementation of Linear Regression and Neural Network models for house price prediction.
- house_prices.py: Generates synthetic data and saves it to house_prices.csv.
